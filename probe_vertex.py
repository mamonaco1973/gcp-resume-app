"""Probe which Vertex AI Gemini models actually answer, and how fast.

Why this exists
    gemini-config.sh pins one model id for the whole project, and check_env.sh
    verifies that one id with a single curl. Neither answers the question you
    actually have when picking it: which models will this project's service
    account serve today, in this location, and what do they cost you in
    latency?

    Model Garden availability is not uniform. A model id can be perfectly
    valid, be listed by the publisher API, and still return 404 or 403 for a
    given project and location -- because it was never enabled, because the
    service account lacks aiplatform.user, or because that model is simply not
    offered in that location. As with the OCI probe this is modelled on, the
    only reliable test is to make the call.

    So this makes the call, against the same REST path the worker's SDK uses,
    and reports what answers and how quickly.

Usage
    python3 probe_vertex.py                     # probe the known Gemini models
    python3 probe_vertex.py flash               # only ids matching a filter
    python3 probe_vertex.py --tokens 800        # realistic generation length
    python3 probe_vertex.py --location us-central1
    python3 probe_vertex.py --check gemini-2.5-flash-lite

    --check verifies one exact id and communicates through the exit code, so a
    shell pre-flight can gate a deploy on it -- the same contract
    probe_genai.py offers in the OCI project.

Requirements
    gcloud, jq, and credentials.json in this directory -- the same three things
    check_env.sh already needs. Deliberately NO Python dependencies: the worker
    reaches Vertex through google-cloud-aiplatform, but that SDK is a POST to
    the endpoint below, and requiring it here would mean the venv dance the OCI
    probe has to do just to run a liveness check.
