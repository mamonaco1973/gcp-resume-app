# GCP Serverless Resume Scoring Application with Vertex AI, Cloud Functions, Firestore, Pub/Sub, and API Gateway

This project delivers a fully automated **serverless resume scoring application**
on GCP, built using **GCP API Gateway**, **Cloud Functions 2nd Gen**,
**Cloud Firestore**, **Cloud Pub/Sub**, and **Vertex AI (Gemini)**.

It uses **Terraform** and **Python** to provision and deploy an
**asynchronous, AI-powered scoring pipeline** secured with **JWT-based
authentication**, allowing users to upload resumes and submit job postings for
compatibility scoring — all without running or managing any virtual machines.

Users submit a resume and a job posting (as a URL, raw text, or LinkedIn job
ID). The application uses **Vertex AI Gemini** to extract structured job
metadata and score the resume against the job on a scale of 0–100, with a
written analysis broken into **Strengths** and **Weaknesses** sections.

Authentication and authorization are handled natively by **GCP Identity
Platform (Firebase Auth)**, allowing users to sign in with email-based
credentials directly in the app. Firebase JWTs are validated by API Gateway
before requests reach Cloud Functions.

A **vanilla JavaScript single-page application** hosted on GCS integrates
with Identity Platform's JavaScript SDK and interacts directly with the secured
API, allowing authenticated users to manage resumes, submit jobs for scoring,
and review AI-generated analysis from a browser.

This design follows a **serverless event-driven architecture** where API
Gateway routes authenticated requests to a Cloud Function, Pub/Sub decouples
job submission from scoring, and Vertex AI handles inference on demand — with
GCP managing scaling, availability, and fault tolerance automatically.

The Gemini model is fully parameterized — see
[Changing the Gemini Model](#changing-the-gemini-model). Swapping models
requires only editing one export line in `gemini-config.sh`.

## Key Capabilities Demonstrated

1. **AI-Powered Resume Scoring** – Vertex AI Gemini extracts job metadata and
   scores resume-to-job compatibility (0–100) with a written
   Strengths/Weaknesses analysis.
2. **Asynchronous Job Processing** – Pub/Sub decouples job submission from
   scoring. The API returns immediately with a `submitted` status while a
   worker Cloud Function processes the job in the background.
3. **Native GCP Authentication** – Identity Platform (Firebase Auth) issues and
   manages JWTs, eliminating the need for custom authentication logic in Cloud
   Functions. API Gateway validates tokens via OpenAPI `securityDefinitions`.
4. **Serverless Event-Driven Architecture** – No VMs, containers, or VPC
   networking required. Cloud Functions scale on demand and cost nothing at idle.
5. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** – Terraform provisions all resources —
   API Gateway, Cloud Functions, Firestore, Pub/Sub, GCS, IAM, and Vertex AI
   permissions — across three independent phases.
6. **Firestore Data Model** – Resumes and jobs are stored in separate Firestore
   collections with `{owner_uid}_{resource_id}` document IDs for per-user
   data isolation.
7. **Browser-Based Frontend** – A static GCS-hosted SPA demonstrates in-page
   Firebase auth and real-time polling for scoring results.

## Architecture

![diagram](aws-resume-app.png)

## Prerequisites

* [A GCP Project](https://console.cloud.google.com/) with billing enabled
* [Install gcloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)
* [Install Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install)
* [Install Python 3.11+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [Install jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/download/)
* A **service account key file** (`credentials.json`) in the repo root with
  Owner or the following roles:
  - `roles/iam.serviceAccountAdmin`
  - `roles/iam.serviceAccountKeyAdmin`
  - `roles/resourcemanager.projectIamAdmin`
  - `roles/storage.admin`
  - `roles/datastore.owner`
  - `roles/pubsub.admin`
  - `roles/cloudfunctions.admin`
  - `roles/apigateway.admin`
  - `roles/identitytoolkit.admin`
  - `roles/aiplatform.admin`
  - `roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin`
  - `roles/apikeys.admin`

`credentials.json` is listed in `.gitignore` and must never be committed.

If this is your first time using GCP with Terraform, we recommend reviewing
the [gcloud quickstart](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstart) and
ensuring your project has billing enabled before running `apply.sh`.

## Download this Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mamonaco1973/gcp-resume-app.git
cd gcp-resume-app
```

Place your service account `credentials.json` in the repo root before
running any scripts.

## Build the Code

Run [check_env](check_env.sh) to validate your environment, then run
[apply](apply.sh) to provision all infrastructure and deploy the frontend.

```bash
~/gcp-resume-app$ ./apply.sh
NOTE: Running environment validation...
NOTE: Validating that required commands are found in your PATH.
NOTE: gcloud is found in the current PATH.
NOTE: terraform is found in the current PATH.
NOTE: jq is found in the current PATH.
NOTE: pip is found in the current PATH.
NOTE: credentials.json found. Project: my-project-id

=================================================================================
  App : https://storage.googleapis.com/resume-web-<hex>/index.html
  API : https://resume-gateway-<hex>.uc.gateway.dev
=================================================================================
```

`apply.sh` performs the following steps in order:

1. Sources `gemini-config.sh` to set `GEMINI_MODEL_ID`
2. Runs `check_env.sh` to validate CLI tools, `credentials.json`, and Vertex AI access
3. Installs Python dependencies into `02-functions/code/api/` and `02-functions/code/worker/`
4. Runs `terraform apply` on `01-backend` — provisions service accounts, IAM, GCS media bucket, Pub/Sub, and Identity Platform API key
5. Runs `terraform apply` on `02-functions` — deploys Cloud Functions and API Gateway
6. Runs `terraform apply` on `03-webapp` — creates the public GCS website bucket
7. Reads Terraform outputs and writes `03-webapp/site/js/config.js` from the template
8. Syncs the frontend to the GCS website bucket (excluding `*.tmpl` files)
9. Runs `validate.sh` to print the live URLs

### Build Results

When the deployment completes, the following resources are created:

- **Core Infrastructure:**
  - Fully serverless architecture — no VMs, containers, or VPC networking required
  - Three independent Terraform state phases for clean separation of concerns
  - Asynchronous scoring pipeline decoupled via Pub/Sub for reliable processing

- **Security, Identity & IAM:**
  - **GCP Identity Platform** (Firebase Auth) providing managed user authentication
    and JWT issuance with email-based sign-up
  - API Gateway **Firebase JWT validation** via OpenAPI `securityDefinitions`
    (`x-google-issuer`, `x-google-jwks_uri`, `x-google-audiences`)
  - Dedicated service accounts (`resume-api-sa`, `resume-worker-sa`) scoped to
    least-privilege; no shared credentials between functions
  - `credentials.json` key file kept out of version control via `.gitignore`

- **Cloud Firestore:**
  - Two collections: `resume_app_resumes` and `resume_app_jobs`
  - Document IDs: `{owner_uid}_{resource_id}` for per-user data isolation
  - Composite indexes on `owner ASC, created_at DESC` for efficient list queries

- **Cloud Functions 2nd Gen:**
  - **`resume-api`** (HTTP, 256 MB, 60 s) — routes all API Gateway requests to
    resume and job CRUD handlers; extracts owner UID from the
    `X-Apigateway-Api-Userinfo` header injected by API Gateway
  - **`resume-worker`** (Eventarc/Pub/Sub, 512 MB, 300 s) — decodes job
    requests, fetches URLs with HTML stripping, calls Gemini for extraction
    and scoring, writes results to GCS, updates Firestore

- **Cloud Pub/Sub:**
  - `resume-job-requests` topic receives job scoring requests from `resume-api`
  - Subscription with 300 s ack deadline aligned to the worker function timeout
  - Dead-letter topic (`resume-job-requests-dlq`) captures messages that fail
    after 5 attempts (backoff 10 s–600 s)

- **Vertex AI (Gemini):**
  - **Extraction call** — given raw page text or a job URL, extracts
    `job_title`, `company_name`, and a cleaned `job_text` (capped at 3000 chars)
  - **Scoring call** — scores the resume against the cleaned job description
    (0–100) with a written analysis covering Overview, Strengths, and Weaknesses
  - Model parameterized via `GEMINI_MODEL_ID` environment variable

- **Cloud Storage:**
  - **Media bucket** (`resume-media-{suffix}`) — stores resume text, job
    descriptions, resume snapshots, job analyses, and user notes at
    deterministic per-job paths; private, uniform bucket-level access
  - **Website bucket** (`resume-web-{suffix}`) — hosts the static SPA with
    `allUsers` objectViewer and GCS website hosting enabled

- **GCP API Gateway:**
  - Single gateway routes all `/resumes` and `/jobs` paths to `resume-api` via
    `x-google-backend` (h2 protocol)
  - OpenAPI 2.0 spec with Firebase JWT `securityDefinitions`
  - OPTIONS methods left unauthenticated for CORS preflight

- **Static Web Application (GCS):**
  - Vanilla JavaScript SPA with no build step or framework dependencies
  - Firebase JS SDK v11.1.0 loaded via HTML importmap — no npm required
  - In-page sign-in/sign-up modal; `onAuthStateChanged` drives the entire UI
  - Polls `GET /jobs` (5 s auto-refresh) to surface scoring results as they complete
  - `config.js` is generated at deploy time from a template — never edited directly

Together, these resources form a **secure, AI-powered serverless application**
that demonstrates modern GCP architecture principles — **event-driven,
fully managed, and identity-aware** — with all AI inference handled on demand
through Vertex AI.

## Changing the Gemini Model

The model is parameterized end-to-end. To retarget, edit the `export` line in
[gemini-config.sh](gemini-config.sh) — sourced by both `apply.sh` and
`check_env.sh`:

```bash
export GEMINI_MODEL_ID="gemini-2.0-flash-001"
```

This value flows automatically to:

- **`check_env.sh`** — pre-flight probe that the model is accessible before
  any Terraform runs
- **`02-functions/` Terraform** — worker Cloud Function `GEMINI_MODEL_ID`
  environment variable
- **`02-functions/code/worker/main.py`** — reads `GEMINI_MODEL_ID` at runtime
  and passes it to the Vertex AI SDK

If the new model uses a different prompt format or response schema, also update
the prompt strings in [02-functions/code/worker/main.py](02-functions/code/worker/main.py).

## Destroy

```bash
./destroy.sh
```

Tears down all infrastructure provisioned by `apply.sh`. The destroy script:

1. Runs `terraform destroy` on `03-webapp`
2. Runs `terraform destroy` on `02-functions`
3. Empties the GCS media bucket via `gcloud storage rm`
4. Deletes all Firestore documents from both collections via the REST API
5. Runs `terraform destroy` on `01-backend`

## Using the Application

Once deployed, open the **App URL** printed by `validate.sh` in your browser.
The full workflow is:

### 1. Sign In

Click **Sign In** to open the **authentication modal**. On first use, click
**Create Account**, enter your email address and a password (minimum 6
characters), and click **Create Account** to register.

After account creation you are signed in automatically and the
**Job Scoring Dashboard** appears.

On subsequent visits, click **Sign In**, enter your credentials, and click
**Sign In** to authenticate.

### 2. Add a Resume

Before scoring any jobs you need at least one resume on file.

1. Click **Manage Resumes**.
2. Click **New Resume**, give it a name (e.g. `Software Engineer Resume`), and
   paste the full plain-text content of your resume into the text area.
3. Click **Create Resume**. The resume is stored in GCS and available
   immediately for scoring.

You can create multiple resumes (e.g. one tailored for backend roles, one for
management) and choose between them at scoring time. Use the sidebar to switch
between resumes, edit text, or delete ones you no longer need.

### 3. Score a Job

1. Click **Score New Job**.
2. Select the resume you want to score against from the **Resume** dropdown.
3. Choose a **Source Type**:

   | Source Type | When to use |
   |-------------|-------------|
   | **Job URL** | Paste a direct link to any publicly accessible job posting (LinkedIn, Indeed, company careers page, etc.) |
   | **Paste Job Description** | Paste the raw job description text directly — useful when a URL requires login |
   | **LinkedIn Job IDs** | Enter one or more numeric LinkedIn job IDs (one per line) to batch-submit multiple jobs at once |

4. Click **Submit**. The job is queued immediately and the modal closes.

### 4. Monitor Scoring Progress

The dashboard shows all submitted jobs. While a job is being processed:

- The **Status** badge for that row shows `submitted` or `Scoring`.
- A **spinner and countdown** appear in the toolbar — the list refreshes
  automatically every 5 seconds until all pending jobs reach a terminal state.
- You can also click **Refresh** at any time to poll immediately.

Scoring typically takes **15–60 seconds** depending on Gemini response time
and whether the job URL requires fetching and HTML parsing.

### 5. View the Analysis

Once the status changes to **Scored**, click **Open** to view the full result.
The job detail page shows:

- **Score** — a 0–100 compatibility rating
- **Analysis** — Overview, Strengths, and Weaknesses sections generated by Gemini
- **Job Description** — the cleaned job text used for scoring
- **Resume Snapshot** — the version of your resume that was scored (captured
  at submission time, so edits to the resume afterwards do not affect past scores)

### 6. Add Notes

On the job detail page you can type personal notes (interview prep, recruiter
contact details, application status, etc.) into the **Notes** field and save
them. Notes are stored in GCS and are private to your account.

### 7. Delete Jobs

Click **Delete** on any row in the dashboard to permanently remove the job
record and all associated GCS artifacts (job description, resume snapshot,
analysis, and notes). This action is confirmed via a prompt and cannot be
undone.
